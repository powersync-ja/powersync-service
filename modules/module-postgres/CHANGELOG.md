### Patch Changes

- 57bd18b: Updates from Replication events changes
- 57bd18b: - Introduced modules to the powersync service architecture
  - Core functionality has been moved to "engine" classes. Modules can register additional functionality with these engines.
  - The sync API functionality used by the routes has been abstracted to an interface. API routes are now managed by the RouterEngine.
  - Replication is managed by the ReplicationEngine and new replication data sources can be registered to the engine by modules.
  - Refactored existing Postgres replication as a module.
  - Removed Postgres specific code from the core service packages.
